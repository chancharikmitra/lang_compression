class TransformerDecoderTextualHead(TextualHead):
    r"""
    A textual head composed of four main modules: (1) input projection (linear
    layer) for visual features to match size with textual features, (2) word
    and positional embedding for input captions, (3) a unidirectional transformer
    decoder, and (4) and output projection (linear layer) to predict a
    distribution over vocabulary tokens. The word embedding weights are tied
    with output projection; the latter still has its own learnable bias.

    .. note::

        For the "bicaptioning" pretraining task, our *textual head* (as defined
        in the paper) must have two transformer decoders: one each to decode
        caption in either direction. This class however will always have one
        transformer per object.

        Refer :class:`~virtex.models.captioning.BidirectionalCaptioningModel`
        source to understand how an object of this class is cloned, along with
        tying embedding and output weights, for bicaptioning.

        Hence, while there are *two objects* of this class, it is pragmatically
        a *single* textual head as a whole, according to the terminology used
        in paper.

    Args:
        visual_feature_size: Size (number of channels) of the input features from
            the visual backbone.
        vocab_size: Number of tokens in the output vocabulary.
        hidden_size: Size of the token embedding vectors, or hidden state vector of
            the language model.
        num_layers: Number of layers in the transformer.
        attention_heads: Number of attention heads in the transformer.
        feedforward_size: Size of feedforward layers in the transformer.
        dropout: Dropout probability for transformer (applied after layernorm).
        norm_first: Whether to apply normalization before or after attention/FF
            layers. The former type are called pre-norm variants (like GPT-2) and
            latter are post-norm variants (like BERT). Default is post-norm.
        mask_future_positions: Whether to mask future positions for self-attention
            over caption tokens. This must be ``True`` for captioning (and
            bicaptioning) tasks to prevent the language model from cheating, and
            ``False`` for masked language modeling, as the self-attention should
            consider all tokens.
        max_caption_length: Maximum length of input captions; this is used to
            create a fixed positional embedding lookup table.
        padding_idx: Token index of ``[PAD]`` token, word embedding for these
            tokens will be a vector of zeroes (and not trainable).
